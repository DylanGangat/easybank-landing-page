### What I learned 🧠

This project was a bit more complex compared to my previous Front-end Mentor Challenge but I was determined to complete it and learnt a few things on the way.

- I learnt how to make a responsive navigation that switches into a toggle menu. This really tested my critical thinking and planning skills. On how to set up the html.

- One of the most difficult parts of the project was figuring how to make the hero section responsive and on the way I learnt a lot more about positioning elements with background properties and stacking context.

- I also spent a bit of time on trying to add a simple animation to the toggle menu. I learnt a valuable lesson that animations don't work with `display: none;`

- Spent a bit of time praticing my DOM manipulation skills by making the navigation toggle and changing it's button on a click event.

### Favorite selector from this project 🥇

This was my favorite selector due to me exploiting the power it has to make items responsive with only one line of code which I think is amazing!

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(15rem, 1fr));
```
### Useful resources 🔖

[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=coder+coder) - I have to give credit where credit is due after struggling for a while with the hero section I went to youtube to get ideas on how I could make the pictures responsive and Coder Coder really help out with it. Youtube is a great place for guidance when you get stuck and can't find a solution on Stack Overflow or MDN.
